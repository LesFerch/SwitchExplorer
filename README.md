## Switch the Windows 11 default Explorer

This program switches (i.e. toggles) the Windows 11 default file manager back and forth between the the current version and the Windows 10 Explorer. That is, if your current Explorer is the Windows 11 version, double-clicking this program will switch to the Windows 10 version (the same one you can get to via the Control Panel). Double-clicking again will switch back to the current Windows 11 Explorer.

The switch is accomplished by applying or removing the registry entries shown [here](https://www.elevenforum.com/t/restore-classic-file-explorer-with-ribbon-in-windows-11.620/#Three). You do not need to look at those registry entries. The link is provided as an FYI only.

**Note**: SwitchExplorer.exe requires Windows 11 22H2 or 23H2 with build revision 3007 or higher.

**Note**: When switched to the Windows 10 Explorer, the Details pane will still be the new Windows 11 version. If you want to get the old Details pane, that allows direct editing of metadata, you will need to directly launch the Windows 10 Explorer. You can do that with the [OldExplorer](https://lesferch.github.io/OldExplorer) tool.
